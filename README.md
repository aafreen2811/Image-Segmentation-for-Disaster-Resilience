# Image-Segmentation-for-Disaster-Resilience

A comprehensive disaster detection and assessment system using satellite and drone imagery segmentation. This project employs Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to classify and analyze disaster-affected regions such as floods, landslides, and collapsed infrastructure. It aids in effective disaster management, emergency response, and long-term mitigation planning. Future improvements include the use of higher-resolution imagery and real-time processing capabilities.

This project focuses on segmenting satellite and aerial images to detect and assess the impact of various natural disasters. By analyzing terrain and structural changes, the system identifies affected areas to support disaster relief, resource distribution, and recovery strategies.

### üîç **Features**

* **Image Segmentation**: Analyzes satellite and drone images to identify disaster-impacted areas (floods, landslides, collapsed buildings, etc.).
* **Deep Learning Integration**: Utilizes models like UNet, DeepLabV3+, and Mask R-CNN for pixel-level segmentation and classification.
* **Change Detection**: Compares pre-disaster and post-disaster images to measure damage severity.
* **Disaster Management Application**: Supports emergency response teams by mapping affected zones and generating reports.
* **Web Dashboard** *(optional)*: Visualizes segmentation results, heatmaps, and downloadable assessments.
